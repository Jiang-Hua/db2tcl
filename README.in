WHAT IS DB2TCL?
===============

DB2TCL is an extension to the Tool Command Language (TCL) that
provides high-level access to a IBM UDB DB2 database server. 

DB2TCL features:

REQUIREMENTS
============

Since DB2TCL is an extension to Tcl, you should already have Tcl, or be
prepared to get it via FTP:

    ftp://ftp.scriptics.com/pub/tcl8_0

If you want compile Tk interface for IBM DB2 you must have 
Tk library also. 

Of course, you must also have access to a IBM DB2 system. Additionally,
you must have the IBM DB2 SDK package that provides header files and
object libraries. See IBM DB2 homepage:

    http://www-3.ibm.com/software/data/db2/udb/

DB2TCL supports building a dynamic load library on systems that support
dynamic loading.  If you build static libraries and executables, 
I recommend building with Extended Tcl.

NOTE
====

DB2TCL tested only on Linux systems!
